## General Tips


- Decrease the complexity of a move if you're struggling with it.
- Restrict some of your practice time to your non-dominant hand.
- Intentionally miss the pattern to see where your props are dropping. Intentionally making a mistake is great for any activity you do â€” it keeps your ego in check. 
- Go for either controlled runs or do as many runs as you can. You have to use your judgement<sup class="secondary-a" > <a href= "#footnotes"> 1. </a> </sup> in knowing the timing to do so.
- Change your point of focus: focus on your arms, focus on your fingers.
- Try to go faster or slower than usual.
- Film yourself, you're not immune to mistakes.
- Watch good tutorials. 
- Make it fun.

&nbsp; 

When you practice, it's unrealistic to load all these questions in your mind. Pick one or a few to answer in your practice sessions. 



<br/>

## Balls
### 4 Ball Mills Mess




Try:  3, 441 and 531 Mills Mess.

- By filming, I can see that I release the ball too early from under the shoulder so my throws look static and choppy.
- My arms also look like bricks which means I have to loosen them up.
- The cross throws to the opposite hand don't travel horizontally enough. This means I have to practice clean cross throws in a simple 3 ball Mills Mess.
- It's important to keep your elbows close to your chest. When doing the trick, your arms will naturally feel tired from being crossed together, and that leads to missed throws.


 

###  6 Ball Fountain
Try:  three  in one with the non-dominant hand.
- Try keeping your elbows glued to your ribs. Elbows too far apart will tire you out.
- Wrists towards your face if the balls are dropping far away from you.
- Keep your arms tight and closer than you would expect.
- Drawing circles with the rotation of the elbows.
- 3 in 1 with a pulling motion inward.
- Watch out for inconsistent heights and orbits between each hand.  


&nbsp;



### 7 Ball Cascade
Try:  4 Ball Snake


- What's your initial position looking like? Are your arms low and wrists relaxed?
- Are you throwing your balls too low?
- Are you rushing to throw the balls? 
- What ball(s) is giving you trouble?
- No fear throwing.
- Throw high with more horizontal spread.
- Try to maintain uniformity in the ball heights.
- Don't think of it as juggling 7 balls. Try to think of it as 5 balls with an extra 2.
- Relax while throwing. Every ball should be thrown comfortably, with consistent force.
- Lower your arms if you're starting too high. Starting too high gives you less momentum when throwing.
- Make sure the balls are drawing similar orbits in the air.


<br/>

Remember that you lose accuracy from throwing higher. This breaks your form and makes you rush the pattern. It's ok drop your props, breathe a bit, and do it again.

## Clubs

### 5 Clubs
Try: 4 club half-shower, 55050, 55500.
 
- Focus on the uniformity of spins.
- Throw higher than you think you need to.
- Throw close to you, don't tire your arms.
- Add triple spins in your 4 club patterns.
