## Heads up

Starting with <a class="secondary-a"  href="/posts/post-1/" > juggling tips, </a> I've decided to continue the tradition and post more personal tips/advice for the disciplines I like. I've started to enjoy the challenge of modifying personal notes to make them understandable for the public. During that process, I can navigate ways of finding better words to express certain ideas, see which sentences read awkwardly and, all in all, revamp my writing style.
