## Why?

There are countless fitness apps on the app store packed with great features. A bunch of them include neat features such as tracking macros, creating and sharing workouts within a community, and even logging water intake and sleep. Personally, I feel a bit overwhelmed seeing a lot of features condensed into one app. I wanted to try creating an app that focuses only on one aspect: tracking weight and calories.
